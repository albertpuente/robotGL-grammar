/////////////  NEW VERSIONS   /////////////

/////////////  FIRST VERSION  /////////////
v: 1.0
date: 21/4/2014

features:
    - translates actions
    - translates the following instructions:
        - assignment
        - while
        - if
        - function calls
    - translates the following expressions:
        - all but unary operators (ex: myFunction -20) and the MOD (%) operation
    - checks for invalid calls and invalid uses of variables
        - throws exception (which contains id + line number)
    - indents code
    
notes:
    - the UndefinedVariableException will probably become a more general exception
      that will only be thrown once, and that will contain all the translation errors and not
      just the first.
